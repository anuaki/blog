        </center>
        <div class="container">
            <strong>1.Free diving</strong>
            <p>Freediving is training your body for long spells under water without the use of any diving equipment. It’s all about holding your breath underwater and exploring the world underwater. The goal is to challenge oneself and test your limits, thus improving your ability and pushing your limits further.</p>
            <strong>2.Water aerobics</strong>
            <p>Water aerobics is a form of exercise where aerobics are performed in shallow water. It is beneficial for one and all, including the elderly. The use of water supports the body and reduces the risk of injury to the muscles and joints, prevents overheating of the body, and is a very safe and simple form of exercise. It helps strengthen muscles, and can be done even if you are not a good swimmer.</p>
            <strong>3.Parasailing</strong>
            <p>A parasail is a parachute that is specially designed to be towed behind a boat. You can enjoy a breathtaking view of the water and horizon with a fun-filled ride. Commercial parasailing operations are held all over the world, and there are many parasailing associations that govern the sport held for the game as well.</p>
            <strong>4.Scuba diving</strong>
            <p>It is a type of underwater diving using a scuba set – that generally consists of an air hose, mouthpiece, regulator, harness, back plate, and an air tank – to breathe underwater. Scuba diving is very popular, and undertaken for many reasons that include recreational, scientific, commercial, professional, or public service.</p>
            <strong>5.Snorkeling</strong>
            <p>Snorkeling is swimming on the surface or through water with a diving mask, fins, and a hollow tube called a snorkel (a pipe that helps you breathe underwater). It is a popular recreational activity and is appealing due to its simple nature. You can observe underwater life and corals without any training or equipment like in scuba diving. Water sports like underwater rugby, spearfishing, and underwater hockey are played using snorkeling equipment.</p>
            <strong>6.Underwater photography</strong>
            <p>If you love photography, this will be an ideal sport for you. Diving in the deep blue waters equipped with a camera offers exquisite, exciting, and rare photographic moments. It is often performed while scuba diving with a waterproof camera and appropriate light setup. Digital cameras have drastically changed many facets of underwater photography.</p>
            <strong>7.Barefoot skiing</strong>
            <p>Water skiing using just your feet is barefoot skiing. Balance plays a crucial role in this sport. It is fun to be towed along with the boat, and is also a great hobby. It is one of the most popular water sports today</p>
            <strong>8.Spearfishing</strong>
            <p>Spearfishing is an ancient method of fishing using sharpened sticks to catch fish. Technology has changed spearfishing – which now involves the use of air-powered spearguns or slings along with various diving equipment. The original technique is to hold your breath underwater to spear fish with no bait, being very specific and selective. Hence, it is the most environment-friendly form of fishing.</p>
