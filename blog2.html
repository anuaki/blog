            <h2>INDIVIDUAL WATER SPORTS</h2>
        </center>
        <div class="container">
            <strong>1.Swimming</strong>
            <p>One of the most popular water sports, swimming has been around for centuries. It has evolved to become one of the most common recreational activities as well. Swimming competitions are many, out of which the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics are the most prestigious, and are governed by the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA). Swimming is a sport that tests your fitness and stamina.</p> 
            <strong>2.Surfing</strong>
            <p>Surfing is riding a surfboard on the forward face of a wave, which mostly carries you towards the shore. There are different types of surfing that depend on the length of the surfboard, its design, the form of the wave that is ridden, and the style of riding. Balance plays a critical role in maintaining the posture on the various equipment that can be used for surfing. These include surfboards, surf mats, long-boards, stand up paddle boards, wave-skis, knee-boards, or skim-boards.</p> 
            <strong>3.Wind Surfing</strong>
            <p>The radical technique of surfing, combined with sailing know-how and skill, is what windsurfing is all about. The equipment used here is a surfboard with a sail fixed on a movable mast. The windsurfer has to move with the waves to control the board, and at the same time manage the sail according to the winds. This is a surface water sport, and there are a lot of competitions, both local and international, as well as an Olympic event for this sport.</p> 
            <strong>4.Cliff diving</strong>
            <p>Cliff diving is one form wherein divers jump off cliffs or rocks in freshwater or salt water. It is fun to just dive off a high cliff into the calm waters below. A World Series Cliff Diving Competition is held every year. The height from which divers plunged into the waters below was 85 feet â€“ equal to jumping off an eight-story building! Avid cliff divers travel the world in search of exotic locations to experience the thrill and ultimate rush.</p> 
            <strong>5.Water skiing</strong>
            <p>Another water surface sport, water skiing is basically skiing on water. An individual uses 2 skis or a single ski to skim or glide along the surface of water, and is pulled along by a high-speed powerboat with the help of a ski cable or rope. On a competitive basis, show water skiing and slalom skiing are followed, along with standard dual skiing. Water skiing has been a part of all major water sports championships including the Olympics, World Games, and World Championships.</p> 
            <strong>6.Jet skiing</strong>
            <p>Jet skiing is basically racing over a body of water on a one-man watercraft machine. Fancy stunts and tricks, like flipping and jumping over a ramp, can be done with freestyle jet skiing. Competitive racing is also done between 10-20 racers over a set course. Though it is yet to be recognized as an Olympic event, it was included in the Asian Beach Games recently.</p> 
            <strong>7.Triathlon</strong>
            <p>Triathlon is a type of race that popularly involves swimming, cycling, and running various distances in immediate succession. It is a highly popular sport and was recently included in the Olympics. The Ironman series and World Cup Championships are organized every year. It is a test of your physical fitness, and stamina.</p> 
            <strong>8.Skimboarding</strong>
            <p>Again a board sport, but with a twist. Unlike surfers who start deep into the waves by swimming to the deeper parts of the ocean, skimboarders start at the beach, wading with the board into the wash of previous waves. They then catch the next wave back to the beach. The board is smaller than a surfboard. Skimboarding can be done in lakes and rivers as opposed to surfing, which requires a large body of water. World Championships are held and skimboarding contests like the European Skimboard League, United Skim Tour, and Skim USA are held to determine the World Champion of Professional Skimboarding.</p>
